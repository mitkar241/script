### user-management
---
Shell script to manage local user accounts

Error Handling :
 - need to follow up sudden crash

Grouping :
 - Need to add feature to add user(s) to group(s)

User-Del :
 - Need to follow up and test cleaner user del
 - Need to create testcases

Alternative :
 - AddUser and DelUser for 18.04+ Ubuntus
 - Add CLI tutorial

Arguments :
 - `--add` and `--del` arguments are supposed to be `mutually exclusive`.
 - This argument block will be generic for all shell script `CLI`s

Binary :
 - keeping source code as binary is safer
 - `Reference` : [Shell Script Compiler](https://github.com/neurobin/shc)
 - Not sure how safe it is going to be, as some decrypt tools may be available.
